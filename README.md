# Gab_metrics
This Matlab package provides a set of tools for the comparison, matching and interpolation of curves within the family of elastic G^{a,b} metric. Based on an extension of the  Square Root Velocity (SRV) Framework it allows for the efficient computation of geodesics and geodesic distance for arbitrary values of a and b on the space of unparametrized curves. This in turn allows the user to develop  data driven ways to choose the metric constants  in applications.
