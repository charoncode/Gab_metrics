% Helper function for srvf_klr_optimal_reparam. Calculates the L^2-inner
% product between Q1 * G1 and Q2 * G2 with the SRVF action of G1, G2 on Q1,
% Q2.
%
% Inputs
%  Q1, Q2:     Values of the SRVFs
%  G1, G2:     Values of the reparamterization. Note that the inner product
%              is independent of the parametrizations TG1, TG2. Only the
%              path taken by G1, G2 is important.
%  G1ind, G2ind: To speed up evaluation. Q1(G1ind(k)) is the value of Q1
%              evaluated at G1(k).
%
% Outputs
%  E:  Value of the L^2-inner product
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
